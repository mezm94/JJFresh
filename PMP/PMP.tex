\chapter*{Executive Summary}
  The project's goal is to provide Jess and James with an online store for selling their fruit and vegetable, which is expected to increase their revenue. Jess and James are the Bussiness Owners of the project. The teaching team of SWEN90016 would take the role of Subject Matter Expert to help the student team. The customers of JJFresh would be our main external stakeholders.

  All the in-scope and out-scope requirements of the project have been defined and confirmed by Jess and James. Base on the consideration of flexibility and the speed of website delivery, Scrum is chosen as our software development cycle model.

  The business value of this project is to meet the need of the people who want to buy fruit and vegetables from JJFresh but cannot go during the business hours of the physical store. The increase in orders would also increase the revenue of the store. The teaching team can improve their experience in teaching while the student team can gain software development experience from the project. Moreover, fruit and vegetable suppliers can also get more orders from Jess and James. The risks of the project have been analyzed, and possible solutions for them are also provided in this report. 

  The technology we choose to implement the online store is \textit{Wix}. The student team is a virtual team and the basic communication tools are \textit{Zoom} and \textit{Slack}. Our communication plan is detailed.

  The project development took four weeks, from April 27 to May 25, 2020. The project so far is successful, and the website has now been delivered to the market. The online store website can be accessed on \textit{https://pinwang4.wixsite.com/website}. 

  The development of the project didn't consume any funds. But if Jess and James want to upgrade their website to Wix Premium, they would have to pay 10 - 27 US dollars per month. It depends on the Wix plans they choose.
