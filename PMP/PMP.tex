\chapter*{Executive Summary}
  The project's goal is to provide Jess and James with an online store for selling their fruit and vegetable, which is expected to increase their revenue. Jess and James are the Bussiness Owners of the project. The teaching team of SWEN90016 would take the role of Subject Matter Expert to help the student team. The customers of JJFresh would be our main external stakeholders.

  All the in-scope and out-scope requirements of the project have been defined and confirmed by Jess and James. Base on the consideration of flexibility and the speed of website delivery, Scrum is chosen as our software development cycle model.

  The business value of this project is to meet the need of the people who want to buy fruit and vegetables from JJFresh but cannot go during the business hours of the physical store. The increase in orders would also increase the revenue of the store. The teaching team, student team, fruit and vegetable suppliers can also gain benefits from this project. The risks of the project have been analyzed, and possible solutions for them are also provided in this report. 

  The technology we choose to implement the online store is \textit{Wix}. The student team is a virtual team and the basic communication tools are \textit{Zoom} and \textit{Slack}. Our communication plan is detailed.

  The project development will take at most 5 weeks, from April 27 to May 8, 2020. We plan to finish the project within two sprints, each last two weeks. The fifth week is only used for flexible control. 

  The development of the project will not consume any funds. But if Jess and James want to upgrade their website to Wix Premium, they would have to pay 10 - 27 dollar per month. It depends on the plans they choose.

\section{Scope}
\subsection{What is in-scope?}
<TODO: This has been written exhaustively, but remember each of these requirements should be listed separately since they form an important part in the final acceptance and testing of the product. For example, there are two different login functionalities, one for admin and one for customers. You can mention them as different requirements under login system. Each of the requirements should be simple, concise and be verifiable. Example 1: The system shall provide a UI for the customers to login into the system by entering a user name and a password; Example 2: The system shall provide a UI for the customers to login into the system by entering a user name and a password>
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Customers Login functionality}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Customers need an account do the business, purchase vegetable and fruit, on JJFresh online store. If they are new to this online store, they need to register an account with their personal information including personal cellphone number and email.
    \item Customers should be able to log into their account by input the username, in JJFresh online website is the email address, and the password in the UI provided by system.
    \item Customers can browse products without login, but they cannot make any order in this way.
    \item Customer account would be accessible from a single URL
  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{High priority}: An online store website is not only for browsing information but also a platform for trading fruits and vegetables. Without a Login system, customers can not place their orders.

  \item \textbf{Admin Login functionality}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The owners of JJFresh should have an admin account to manage all the orders. The admin accounts are provided by the development team at the first milestone. After the second milestone, they can create more admin account.
    \item They are also be able to login to the admin account by a username, may be the email address, and a password by a UI provided by system.
    \item The admin accounts have the highest management authority. Jess and James can manage the whole business data in the database with the admin account, not just the orders. For example, they can direct modify the illegal information in the customer account without contact the customers first.
    \item Admin account would be accessible from a single URL
  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{High priority}: Admin login functionality is the basic part of the online store website. At least, Jess and James need to manage all the orders with the admin account.

  \item \textbf{Management of personal information}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Users should be able to add or edit their personal information.
    \item The name, delivery address and upon three multiple contact phone numbers are included in the personal information. Delivery address and common contact phone number should be kept up to date.
  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{High priority}: If the customers change their personal information, such as phone number and delivery address, this function is important to avoid some trouble caused by outdated information. It will affect the smooth delivery of the products and cannot contact the buyer

  \item \textbf{Product Menu system}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Website should display all type of the products with different size and price to the users whenever they are going to purchase or just browse it.
    \item In initial stage, JJFresh provide three options for products, the namely fruit box, vegetable box and fruit and vegetable box. Each product has three size, small, medium and large.
  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{High priority}: Product menu system is the important part of the online store website. Online stores need to show its merchandise and relative information, such as price, to customers to promote the business success. If the customers cannot see the products information, they cannot decide whether they need to purchase or not.

  \item \textbf{Delivering time booking system}:  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Customers should be able to select a day and time for delivery.
    \item Delivery options are in hour blocks between 4pm and 7pm. For instance, 4-5pm; 5-6pm and 6-7pm. Only two bookings are allowed in a particular hour, which can guarantee the quality of each delivery service. 
    \item Bookings should be available for the next 7 days only. If the JJFresh deals to much business, it will avoid customers may need to wait more than one week to collect their delivery after purchase.
  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{High priority}: JJFresh online store offers delivery service. More broadly, delivery service is the basic service that online store provided. If the customers must collect their orders in person, the online store will lose its meaning compare to the physical store.

  \item \textbf{Order management system}:  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Customers should be able to place their orders after selecting what they want and putting them into the shopping cart.
    \item Customers should have the options to cancel an order. When the customer cancels an order, message control system would send an email of the cancellation to the customer.
    \item If the customer needs to modify an order, they will need to cancel the existing order and then re-create the order.
    \item Jess and James need to manage all the orders with an admin account through this system. For example, they may delete the problem orders and re-create them for customers.
  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{High priority}: It is the basic part of the purchase function of an online store. If the customer cannot place the order, they can hardly pay for the merchandise. The online store cannot do any business without an order management system.

  \item \textbf{Message confirmation function}: This system will send the relative email message or SMS to the customers after the following behaviors.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item After placing the orders, Jess and James will deal with the orders. If the orders are confirmed, an email message or SMS will be sent to the users to let them know their orders are confirmed.
    \item If the users cancel the orders, system will send an email of the cancellation to the users.
    \item When the delivery finished, system will also send an email or SMS to the users to inform them. It is used to avoid delivering to the wrong people and they collect them while deliveryman and customers still do not realize.  
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \textit{High priority}: Message confirmation function is the important part in the business online. It can eliminate the trouble caused by information asymmetry between the merchants and customers and improve the quality of the service in the business.

  \item \textbf{Database}   
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The database can store all the business information including users, products and orders.
    \item Database can centrally control and manage the data, which convenient the management of all the business data of JJFresh.
    \item In this age, database can provide the rich data source to many projects, such as data mining. Jess and James can analyses the past orders information in the database to improve their service.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \textit{High priority}: A database is an essential part of the online business. It provides an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{What is out-of-scope?}
The features in the future enhancements are out-of-scope:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An online payment system is not included in the initial development of the project. The physical delivery details need to be considered by Jess and James.
  \item No AI solution would be provided to help improve the delivery process.
  \item Adding multiple bookings for the same time slot is not currently allowed. Only two bookings are allowed in a particular hour.
\end{enumerate}

Also, the features below are out-of-scope:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item No navigation system on delivery is included. The system will not verify the authenticity of the address. Jess and James have to find their way to their customers' addresses themselves.
  \item No delivery distance calculate function would be provided. The system will not judge whether the address is too far, so Jess and James have to decide whether they would deliver to an address or not.
  \item Communication service with customers except confirmation message sending is not included. Jess and James have to decide how to communicate with their customers themselves.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Delivery approach}
\label{sec:deliveryApproach}
The delivery approach we choose for our project is \textbf{Scrum}, an agile method that can provide high flexibility and quick delivery. Our decision is based on the following reasons.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Scrum can provide an incremental delivery system to help the JJFresh online store retain flexibility while continually producing outcomes. As each sprint backlog represents a new release of the product, the sprint process provides an increment delivery system, which can shorten the time for saleable product delivery. The sprint review in the Scrum process can help the software development meet the requirement of the stakeholders. Also, the sooner the application enters the market, the sooner the project team can get feedback from the users to improve their product, which can help improve the user experience. Clients are continuously involved during every stage. And it can reduce waste and rework and increase the satisfaction of clients.
  \item The sprint process in the Scrum model can provide regular adaptation to changing circumstances. Unlike the Waterfall model, which is very difficult to move back to makes changes in the previous phases, using Scrum would make the development of the JJFresh online store website able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, allowing for changes to be easily incorporated if required.
  \item By doing sprint review and sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint, the client and team know exactly what is complete and what is not. This reduces the risk in the development process.
  \item Scrum intends small or mid-sized dedicated teams with high coordination, which is suitable for our team with five members. The Waterfall model, which involves large teams and lack of coordination among team members, can not meet our needs.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Business Value}
\label{sec:businessValue}
JJFresh is currently busy in the morning but almost empty in the afternoon. The deployment of this project will keep JJFresh's existing customers who shop in the morning and shift the afternoon business hours from offline to online, which offers delivery service for current and potential customers who cannot go to JJFresh store at that time. The online store will operate 24 / 7, which is much longer compare to the old business hours, thus provides customers with the convenience of placing orders at any time. With these advantages, the online store project would attack more customers for JJFresh. The increase in customers can increase fruit and vegetable orders, and therefore help Jess and James gain more financial benefits and avoid JJFresh from being closed. The financial and Non-Financial benefits for different stakeholders are shown in Table \ref{tab:businessValue}.

\begin{tabularx}{0.95\linewidth}{%

  \toprule
  Stakeholders & Financial benefits & Non-Financial Benefits \\
  \midrule
  Jess and James
  & Jess and James are the business owners of the JJFresh online store project. The success of the project can help them change their business model. They would gain more customers due to the extension of the business model. Also, the increase in customers would increase the number of orders, which can increase their revenue.
  & They can gain experience in operating an online fruit shop. The online store website can also increase the chance of JJFresh being searched by a search engine of a browser, which can improve the exposure, thereby improving their brand awareness. 
  \\
  \midrule
  The teaching team
  & The teaching team of the Software Processes and Management subject is employed by the school. They can get salary by guiding students.
  & Teaching students in this project can increase their experience in teaching and management.
  \\
  \midrule
  The student team
  & If the project achieves commercial success, students may receive financial awards from Jess and James.
  & They would gain software development experience from the project, which can increase their project experience and help boost their CV. Also, working as a team can improve their teamwork ability.
  \\
  \midrule
  Customers
  & For the customers who are used to buy fruits from JJFresh, home delivery can save them time and money. They don't need to spend money on transportation to jjfresh. Of course, the delivery fee must be considered. But it would be a trade-off.
  & Customers would be able to buy fruits and vegetables with high quality in a more convenient way. Also, for unforeseen circumstances like Covid-19, buying online can reduce their unnecessary travel and keep them safe.
  \\
  \midrule
  Suppliers
  & If the business of JJFresh online store is very good, the business between suppliers and JJFresh will also better. Suppliers will sell more products to the JJFresh.
  & Suppliers can also improve their reputation if their business patterns success, which can offers more opportunities for cooperation with larger business patterns.

\end{tabularx}

\section{Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Team members are lack of experience in Scrum. Scrum is an Agile process and is difficult to do without experience, especially an experienced Scrum master. The student who plays the role of Scrum master has no Scrum management experience before. There may be many problems during the development process.
  \item People in the development team are unfamiliar with creating a website in Wix.com. Also, students who are responsible for the implementation of the project are not full-time workers. The efficiency of their development may be low, which may result in the delay of the project.
  \item A virtual team may not able to follow all the processes in Scrum. Appropriate improvements and compromises would be applied to some specific processes in the Scrum. Communication in a virtual team is less frequent and less rich than face-to-face interaction. Some of the team members are not in Australia, and because of the time difference, daily Scrum will be conducted via chat, which may bring negative effects to the project.
  \item The tool provided by Wix.com only has limited functions, which make it impossible to achieve the requirements perfectly. And the website implement by Wix.com has poor scalability. If Jess and James want to expand their business scale, the development team may have to redevelop the entire project with other web technics.
  \item The delivery range of Jess and James is limited, and users who are too far away cannot get services.
  \item The time limit of the project is only about one month. The overall implementation of the project may not be perfect in such a short time.

\section{Communication Plan}
\label{sec:communicationPlan}
Firstly, as a virtual team, we mainly use \textit{Slack} and \textit{Zoom} for information transfer, such as publishing message notifications, file sharing, etc. The link of each \textit{Zoom} meeting would be released by Scrum Master in the meeting channel of the project \textit{Slack} group. The Scrum Master is responsible for reminding the team to join the meeting in time. The meeting record would be provided by the Scrum Master. The example of our virtual meeting communication system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:meeting}.

\begin{figure}[htp]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/meeting.png}
\caption{Example of our Virtual Meeting Communication System}
\label{fig:meeting}
\end{figure}

Secondly, we use \textit{Trello} to help manage our Agile Board. Both the Project Backlog and the Sprint Backlog are managed on the Agile Board.

Furthermore, \textit{Github} is used to help enhance our teamwork and to manage our outcomes, such as the release of code and report.

According to the constraints of running a virtual team (Section \ref{sec:constraints}), we adjusted some of the communication processes in Scrum, and our communications matrix is shown in table \ref{tab:communicationMatrix}.

  & Although Wix can help quickly implement some basic functions, it may not be suitable for implementing the future enhancement of the project. There are many restrictions on creating a website on Wix. For example, the starter plan (\$5 per month) doesn't remove ads from the website, and there is no unlimited bandwidth or storage plan provided. You cannot build a high availability server in Wix.

The operation of the user to place an order is idempotent, which means that two identical operations will only operate once. If there is a problem with the function of auto-replying emails, the administrator of the maintenance system should be able to detect it in the background, the system is abnormal, and fix the bug in time.

If the order cannot be delivered in time because the seller is sick or other assents, they can decide to hire another person to deliver or cancel their orders. It would be a trade-off between economic loss and user satisfaction loss.
  & Mitigate or accept

Among all technologies we researched above, we choose to use Wix content management system to build the website. Wix requires no coding skills or other usage of frameworks. It supports drag and drop to build web pages and provides a user-friendly UI to set the style of web components that integrates HTML and CSS from codes into user interfaces. And Wix also provides user-friendly UI to react to user actions with event handlers, this supports visualization of JavaScript. So far, Wix substitutes all front end languages or frameworks coding with user interfaces without any code. And Wix conceals the back end code in encapsulated apps, but also let users to implement customized logic using Node.js. Nonetheless, Wix offers a database operated by itself which also supports changes through graphical user interface. This database maintains the consistency of the usage of Wix platform, without extra database construction.

Compare to other website builders, Wix is more flexibly as it supports usage of Node.js to write customized backend code and take action when doing processes. And it already provides ready-made modules including online shop, user login, user permission management, and check out with credit card which can be used in developing the JJFresh website.

Take our project planning into consideration, we will need to implement all features of this website in 4 weeks. To complete the work on time, and not let it take too much time everyday as well, we want to be as efficient as possible, and also take use of the current existing web development tools to avoid building wheels. Nonetheless, we have the constraints that our development team members are not familiar with web development, no matter Wix or other frameworks and technologies.

By using Wix, we will save time of building and integrating the frameworks and adjusting the component properties with the help of visible user interface. And since we don't have much experience in web development, Wix's characteristic that it requires as least coding as possible is suitable us, and can help us focus on project management instead of catching up with the technology stacks. Therefore, we decided to use Wix to develop the website.

\section{Project Planning}
\label{sec:projectPlanning}
The SDLC of our project is Scrum. Since the key requirements for the initial development provided by Jess and James are fixed, a Fixed-Scope Release Planning would be used to plan our project.

\subsection{Product Backlog}
\label{sec:productBacklog}
The detail of product backlog is shown in Table \ref{tab:productBacklog}. \textit{Fabonacci sequence}\footnote{https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/why-the-fibonacci-sequence-works-well-for-estimating} is used to provided relative estimation to both story point and value point.

The story points of different features are estimated by the development team and the Scrum master, based on the volume, risk, uncertainty and complexity of the features. We set the cost of the simplest feature (Edit admin account information) to 1 story point. And then estimate all other features' cost based on comparison with the simplest feature. 

The value points of the features are estimated by the product owners. We set the value of the least value feature (Edit admin account information) to 1 value point. And other features' values are estimated based on their relative value compared to the least value feature. 

BFTB Score is the abbreviate of the Bang-for-the-Buck\footnote{http://leftfoot.com.au/blog/struggling-with-relative-estimation-and-why-we-dont-use-time-watch-this} Score, which is a way of measuring how to get the most value in the shortest time. It is used to help assess the priority of the features. The BFTB Score is calculated by the formula below:
$$
  \text{BFTB Score} = \frac{\text{Value Point}}{\text{Store Point}}
$$

Initially, we define three milestones in our project. The first two milestones would be achieved at the end of the first sprint and at the end of the second sprint, respectively. Whether we would achieve the milestone depending on James and Jess's decision. Every milestone, we would release a runnable website to the market.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first milestone is to let the website go online without the function of purchase. The website can display all kinds of information about the products and provide the service of user registration. At the same time, the database is initially established to record the data of users and products.
\item The second milestone is to allow users to place orders to purchase products. After this milestone, sellers can view and modify user orders. Basic requirement testing has to be passed in this milestone.
\item The third milestone is to finish the future enhancement, which would not be considered in the initial development.
\end{itemize}

The features in Table \ref{tab:productBacklog} are ordered by their priority. The priorities are defined base on both the BFTB score and the development requirements. For example, even though the Database feature has a low BFTB score, because we can't record any data without it, its priority is still the highest.

Except for the three future user stories at the end of the product backlog table, all others are must-have stories because they are key requirements defined by Jess and James.

\subsection{Must-have Story Points}
Without calculating the features needed in the future, the total number of must-have story points is 60.
$$
SP_{total} = 60 \text{ (Story Point)}
$$

\subsection{Velocity Estimating (Re-estimate)}
There are two developers in our team. Since both of them are students, each of them can only spend about 1.2 to 3 hours a day on the project. They can work five days a week, so the total working hours of a week are 12 to 30 hours. We simply suppose each story point to be equivalent to one hour of working time. So the min velocity ($V_{min}$) for a two-week sprint is about 24 story points, and the max velocity ($V_{max}$) is about 60 story points. And by using the formula shown below, we can get our minimum and maximum number of sprints, which are 1 and 2.5, respectively. The velocity re-estimation burndown chart is shown in Figure \ref{fig:velocityEstimate}
$$
S_{min} = \frac{SP_{total}}{V_{max}}
\text{, } 
S_{max} = \frac{SP_{total}}{V_{min}}
$$

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
\subsubsection{Sprint Cycle}
\label{sec:sprintCycle}
The development phase of our project would start on \textbf{Monday, April 25}. Since the final delivery due date of the whole project is \textbf{June 1}, we decided to divide our development into three phases, each corresponding to a sprint.

The first phase is to let the website go online without the function of purchase. The website can display all kinds of information about the products and provide the service of user registration. At the same time, the database is initially established to record the data of users and products. The first sprint will last for two weeks, \textbf{from Monday, April 27 to Friday, May 8}. 

In the second phase, we need to realize the function that users place orders to purchase products, and sellers can view and modify user orders. Preliminary testing will also take place at this phase. The second sprint will last for two weeks, \textbf{from Monday, May 11 to Friday, May 22}.

The third stage is mainly based on user feedback to repair the vulnerability, carry out more tests and improve the existing functions. If some functions left over from the first two sprints are not implemented, they will also be solved in this sprint. As the project is nearing its end and there is less work left, the sprint in this phase will last only one week, \textbf{from Monday, May 25 to Friday, May 29.}

On \textbf{the first Monday of every sprint}, a Sprint Planning meeting would be held to select high priority items from the product backlog that the development team can commit to delivering in a single Sprint. The select itmes would be add to Sprint Backlog.

On \textbf{the last Friday of each sprint}, a Sprint Review meeting would be held to demonstrate the new features to Stakeholders, and a Sprint Retrospective meeting would be held to review the sprint.

A 15-minute Daily Scrum would be held \textbf{everyday} in the first sprint to start up the jobs. Everyone has to share what he/she did yesterday, what he/she plan to do, and what obstacles are slowing him/her.

\subsection{The First Sprint Plan}
As mention in Section \ref{sec:sprintCycle}, the main goal of the first sprint is to launch a webpage where customers can browse products. Considering both the BFTB Score, which is shown in Table \ref{tab:productBacklog} and the actual development needs, the Sprint Backlog of the first sprint is shown in table \ref{tab:firstSprintBacklog}. The total velocity and the delivery value of the first sprint is 30 story points and 25 value points, respectively.

\section{Project Status: Friday Week 9}
\label{sec:ps1}
We finished all the features required in the initial development process on May 18, 2020. However, because the document has to be updated to version 1.2 before May 23, 2020, we can’t update artefacts generated by the second sprint review meeting and the second sprint retrospective to the document in this version. And we would decide whether the third sprint is needed in the comming sprint review. The online store can now be accessed on \textit{https://pinwang4.wixsite.com/website}. It is a beautiful and well designed site, with a user-friendly interface and all the features required in the initial development. A screenshot of the homepage is available in Figure \ref{fig:homepage}

We use a handy tool called \textit{Trello}\footnote{To join the Agile Board: https://trello.com/invite/b/ZqSHe7MR/9b942f7a393fb08379c206fb2064726a/spm-group-project} to manage our Agile Board. The feature cards in the Agile Board are set by the Scrum Master with tasks checklist defined inside them. Students in the development team would add themselves to a specific card and move the card to the \textit{TODO} list after the Daily Scrum standup meeting. A card is moved to \textit{DONE} list only if all the tasks in it are finished and pass tests. The total finish story points can be quickly check in the upper left corner of the \textit{DONE} list. By checking the card in the \textit{DONE} list, the Scrum Master can keep track of everyone’s contribution. A screenshot of the Agile Board system is shown in Figure 4.4.

The burndown chart is updated by the Scrum Master after every daily standup. By comparing the actual jagged line with the ideal schedule straight line, the Scrum Master can easily evaluate whether the development team is working efficiently, whether the sprint backlog can be finished on time and whether the progress of the project is hindered. Also, the burndown chart is used to re-estimate the velocity of the development team. 

In the first sprint, we held daily scrum standup meeting every workday. But since in the first sprint retrospective, our development team said that they might not work for this subject every day and the Daily Scrum Meeting is held too often. So we change the process to be held only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The daily scrum meetings are thought to be very useful since it not only can help our development team to improve their work efficiency but also let other knows what they are working on and what should be solved on a specific date. As mention in Section \ref{sec:constraints}, our team is facing some time difference problem. Daily Scrum were conducted via chat. We do it in the daily-scrum channel in \textit{Slack}. An example of how our daily scrum standup meeting system work is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dailyScrum} in Appendix B. The meeting record is shown in Table \ref{tab:dailyScrumStandupMeetingRecord} in Appendix B.

At the end of the first sprint, a sprint review is held to give a demo on the product to determine what are finished and what are not. The demo is excellent, and together we find out that some unworkable buttons should be deleted in the delivery version. After the sprint review, a sprint retrospective was held to help improve the team's efficiency. All the members in the development team thought the Daily Scrum is great. However, it is held too often since they have to learn other subjects. So, we decide to hold daily scrum standup only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday in the second sprint. The Record of the first pprint review and sprint retrospective can be found in \textit{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4slzV0LbUSY}.

\textbf{The First Sprint Review \& Sprint Retrospective Record (May, 8, 2020)}
\\
The record of these two meetings can be found on \textit{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4slzV0LbUSY}.

In the sprint review, the development team give a presentation to show all the features finished in the first sprint. The Scrum Master and the Product Owners provide reviews for the product. We held the meeting in zoom. From the demo, we find out that there are some unworkable buttons which should be deleted in the delivery version. And after a little change based on the reviews, we release our first product to the market.

In the sprint retrospective, we discuss what went well in the first sprint. All the member in the development team thinks Daily Scrum is great. It helps the development team communicate better because it can provide information about what others are doing. When it comes to the "what could be improved" part, we decide to hold daily scrum standup only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This is because the development team would not work on this subject every day.

\subsection{Product Related Artefacts}
\textbf{The status of the product}
\\
We have finished all the features required in the initial development process. The online store website can be accessed now on \textit{https://pinwang4.wixsite.com/website}. A screenshot of the homepage is shown in Figure \ref{fig:homepage}. The online store website is beautiful and well designed, with a user-friendly interface and all the features required in the initial development. The product design can be found in Appendix C. The use cases and user stories of the product is shown in Table \ref{tab:productBacklog} in Section \ref{sec:productBacklog}, which would not be shown again here. The detail of the features completed in each sprint can be checked in Section \ref{sec:sprintCycle}. Also the completed features detail can be check in our Agile Board in \textit{Trello}, which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:doneFeature}. For a quick look, a completed feature lists (detailed tasks breakdown would not be included here) is provided below:
\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Milestone 1 -- let the website go online without the function of purchase. The website can display all kinds of information about the products and provide the service of user registration. At the same time, the database is initially established to record the data of users and products.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Datebase
    \item Browse product menu
    \item Customer sign up
    \item Customer sign in and sign out
    \item Customer add and edit client information
    \item Admin manage product infomation
    \item Admin sign in and sign out
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Milestone 2 -- Allow users to place orders to purchase products. After this milestone, sellers can view and modify user orders. Basic requirement testing has to be passed in this milestone.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Customer add products to shopping cart
    \item Customer manage shopping cart
    \item Customer check out shopping cart
    \item Customer cancel orders
    \item Admin view and manage orders
    \item Register admin account

\subsection{Risk Monitoring and Control}  
So far, the project has completed all the basic functions, but the four risks defined in the initial stage of development have not yet occurred. One of the main reasons is that the product has not been used. In other words, the risks defined in Section 3.3 all occur after the product is put into use or after simulated use. Therefore, after the product owner, which is a member of our group, simulates the user for testing, we will further analyze these four risks.
At the same time, the development process was relatively smooth, and the content of the plan was completed within the specified time. Therefore, at present, we have not defined new risks.
