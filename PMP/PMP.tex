\chapter*{Executive Summary}\label{sec:ESummary}
Jess and James plans to create an online store of fruits and vegetables as a JJFresh online sales platform for users to select and place orders. In this way, they want to maintain their existing customer base and remain competitive with other stores. In view of the insufficient budget of Jess and James, the students of registered software project management of the University of Melbourne are employed to develop this system. Based on the consideration of the changes in the needs of the project itself and the size of the development team, they chose an agile Scrum model, which will be assigned tasks to members by a short Sprint. They plan to deliver a product that meets core needs to Jess and James within 2 weeks, and complete 3 iterations of development within 4 weeks to deliver a complete website. The product will implement an online sales platform for Jess and James, thereby bringing them additional economic benefits. On the other hand, for the development team, the project will accumulate actual development experience, which will improve their competitiveness in future.

\chapter{Project Information}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Key Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Jess and James: they are product owner who define the features, contents of this project, JJFresh online store website, and responsible for the benefits of it.
  \item Team: In this project, a group of students will come to develop it under the employment of the product owner. The project cannot be developed if there no people come to implement it.
  \item Customer: Consumption by customers is the whole of the business in this project. Customers will purchase fruit and vegetable on Online store, and the consumption is the majority of the income of JJFresh.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Scope}
\subsection{What is in-scope?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item As Jess and James, they want to establish a JJFresh online store website that can serve customers are within 10km. The online store will decrease the opening hours of the retail shop part and cost more time in packing items and delivering.
  \item As customers, they need a platform to purchase fruit and vegetable and it will deliver their orders to their hands, so that they can save the time of traveling to the physical store and be safer than shopping after midnight.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{What is out-of-scope?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Customers: This project does not contain deal with the effect of attracting customers. How many customers will visit and consumption in the online store has nothing to do with the development.
  \item The sales of the online store: When the project is finished, no matter what sales of the online store, it has nothing to do with the project development. Jess and Jame should be responsible for the daily operation of JJFresh online store, including make some discount to attract more people.
  \item Fruit and vegetable suppliers: Because of the online store can sell more products than physical store, so the more suppliers need to be chosen. However, Suppliers have a direct relationship with product owner. This project does not contain deal with the supplier of the online store. Jess and Jame should concern about choosing which suppliers and have the business with them.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Delivery approach / SDLC - Agile}
LHK

Agile Scrum is the popular model that be used for website project.

This project is developed through a student group. Agile Scrum team are typically 6-9 people, without any traditional software engineers, and the team members work together to complete the set of work they have collectively committed to complete within a sprint (1). Compared to the other models, for instance, Incremental SDLC requires more resources and management attention, but the group members are students who need to spend more time on other subjects and cannot obtain enough resources like the professional software engineer.

This project is the online store website which greatly affected by market change and there is may be some change after the process in the underway. For example, product selection in the project maybe add more size of box or more type of box because of the market change during the development. Waterfall SDLC is difficult to accommodate these changes in the development, while Agile Scrum can adapt regular in the changing circumstances.

It is necessary to release the website as soon as possible to promote the online store. The first version can have only the product list and the introduction of online store to attract customers. When the final build online, JJFresh will have many customers who cannot wait to try its products. Agile Scrum can satisfy this point. In the development of this project, Agile Scrum can deliver many versions of project, and face to meet the increasing customer demands and needs. Compare to the Incremental Model, both of them delivery many build.

We choose to use Agile SDLC out of Formal, Agile and Hybrid, because we prefer the following advantages of agile compares to the limitations of a formal model such as waterfall.

Advantages of the Agile Model:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is focused client process. So, it makes sure that the client is continuously involved during every stage. And it can reduce waste and rework and increase the satisfaction of clients.
  \item Agile teams are extremely motivated and self-organized so it likely to provide a better result from the development projects.
  \item Agile software development method assures that quality of the development is maintained
  \item The process is completely based on the incremental progress. Therefore, the client and team know exactly what is complete and what is not. This reduces risk in the development process.
  \item Agile intends small or mid-sized dedicated teams with high coordination, which is suitable for our team with 5 members.
\end{itemize}
Limitations of Waterfall Model:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Very difficult to move back to makes changes in the previous phases. It's unknown whether the client will change their requirements.
  \item The testing process starts once development is over. Hence, it has high chances of bugs to be found later in development where they are expensive to fix.
  \item Waterfall involves large teams. It decreases coordination among team members. While we have only 5 people in the team.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Business Value (Financial \& Non-Financial Benefits)}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item JJFresh would gain more users due to the extension of business mode, so Jess and James can get more economic %profits from the increased number of orders delivered by increased users.
%  \item Customers would be able to buy fruits and vegetables in a more convenient way with quality as good as usual.
%  \item The suppliers can get more orders from JJFresh, and also get more economic profit.
%\end{itemize}
\subsection{Financial benefit}
For Jess and Jame, online store can save the cost of hiring clerks, management and consumption of water and electricity in physical store, while it can bring the potential considerable income and alleviate the pressure caused by poor sales of the physical store.

For student in the team, they may have the reward after when the project is finished.

For customers, the product of online store often lower than the physical store.

\subsection{Non-financial benefit}
For Jess and Jame, the risk of establishing the online store is less than physical store. For instance, the cost of establishing and maintaining the website is less than physical store. Compare to physical store, online store can reduce the risk of products spoilage because of cargo backlog. Online store can serve more customers who may live far away from JJFresh. Hence, Jess and James may have more orders than the physical store.

For student in the team, they will obtain their experience in the development of the project. On one hand, the experience of development may attract students toward world of software project development and may help him/her in the career path on it. On the other hand, the experience can improve students' teamwork ability, which is important in the future.

For customers, online store provides the convenient platform to purchase vegetable and fruit. they can consumption product at night without worrying about the dangerous of going to the physical store. Delivery service can not only also saves the time, but send the products to the customers at the special period. For example, government ask people to reduce unnecessary travel because of coronavirus recently, delivery service will help people to get their products safety.

xxxlhk

JJFresh is currently busy in the morning but almost empty in the afternoon. The deployment of this project will keep JJFrsh's peak business hours to retain old customers who shop in the morning, and shift the afternoon business hours from offline to online, which offers delivery service for current and potential customers who cannot go to JJFresh store at that time. The online store will operate 24 / 7 which is much longer compare to the old business hours, thus provides customers with the convenience of placing orders at any time. With these advantages, the online store project would attack more customers for JJFresh. Therefore can increase fruit and vegetable orders, Jess and James can gain financial benifits, and avoid JJFresh from being closed.

The Deployment of the online store website can also increase the chance of JJFresh being searched by a search engine of a browser, which can improve the exposure, thereby improving brand awareness.

If this business mode achieves success, JJFresh can lead other retail stores to transition from offline to online.

\section{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item team members lack of experience in agile
  \item team members are unfamiliar with wix/front end techniques/other techniques?
  \item wix isn't compatible with other front end languages/frameworks, cannot be customized if needed?
  \item JJFresh didn't do market analysis, whether this business mode will success is unknown
  \item time is limited to 1 month

\section{Communication Plan}
Our group first uses “slack” for the main information transfer, such as publishing message notifications, file sharing, etc. Secondly, using “trello” to arrange the various stages of the project plan and the content is managed by the scrum master. Furthermore, “github” is used to manage output products, such as the release of code and report.

According to the scrum development cycle and the difficulty of this project development, we will conduct a 15-minute meeting discussion on zoom every day, mainly to summarize the results of yesterday and the arrangement of today's tasks. If a team member is absent from a meeting, the person in charge will use email or telephone to communicate with him.

  & Business
  & Jess and James cannot deliver in time due to unforeseen circumstances.
  &
  & If Jess and James cannot deliver the order because of the coronavirus, the economic loss is relatively small. However, if the order information is too large, but the manpower is insufficient, the order cannot be delivered or the delivery is not timely, which will cause the customer to refund the order and bring them huge economic losses. Even they may lose customer expectations and trust.
  & Because of the current coronavirus, when the condition is serious, Jess and James cannot deliver the product to the door. Considering that only two people, Jess and James, are currently packaging and distributing all orders, when there is too much order information or one of them is sick, it is impossible to deliver fruits and vegetables.
  \\
  \midrule

  & Business
  & Cancel orders maliciously or for no reason.
  &
  & The user can cancel the order on the day of product delivery or cancel the agreed order after the seller purchases the goods. These cancellations are unreasonable or caused by the buyer ’s own reasons, but these actions will cause the seller to accumulate vegetables and fruits and waste time and human resources.
  & The buyer may cancel the order for many reasons, but the consequences of this risk need to be borne by the buyer. For example, the buyer may cancel the order because the amount of vegetables and fruits is too large, but it is no longer needed or it is considered more cost-effective. These actions will lead to the occurrence of this risk.
  \\
  \midrule
  4
  & Business
  & Buyer declares that there is a problem with the quality of the product received.
  &
  & The buyer believes that the fruit or vegetable received is not fresh, or the size, softness and hardness do not meet expectations, resulting in a refund and economic loss to the buyer.
  & Because the buyer buys the product according to the pictures and descriptions on the website and does not see the real thing. However, if the seller uploads a virtual picture or picks the best of vegetables and fruits to take a picture, it will result in inconsistency between the items received by the buyer and the picture. As a result, buyers do not recognize the product quality and refund the order.
  \\
  \midrule

  & Project
  & User cannot receive email in time.
  &
  & When the buyer is unable to receive the feedback email in time, the buyer is not sure whether the order has been placed or cancelled successfully. It may cause the buyer to repeat the operation and bring losses to the buyer or seller. Eventually, the user's sense of experience is reduced. For example, a buyer who repeats a booking without receiving an email after ordering a product may cause the buyer to receive 2 copies of the same product and pay an additional fee.
  & If the network conditions of the buyer or the seller are poor, the network is actually delayed, resulting in the buyer not being able to receive the email immediately after performing the operation. At the same time, if there is a problem due to the system's automatic mail reply function, it will also cause the user to not receive the mail.

If the email is not received in time, please contact the seller to check whether the operation is successful. If there is a problem with the function of auto-replying emails, the administrator of the maintenance system should be able to detect it in the background, the system is abnormal, and fix the bug in time.

\section{Technology}
\section{Project Planning}
The SDLC of our project is SCRUM. Since the key requirements for the initial development provided by Jess and James are fixed, a Fixed-Scope Release Planning would be used to plan our project.

\subsection{Product Backlog}
The detail of product backlog is shown in table \ref{tab:productBacklog}. BFTB Score is the abbreviate of the Bang-for-the-Buck Score, which is a way of measuring how to get the most value in the shortest time. It is used to help assess the priority of the features. The BFTB Score is calculated by the formula below:
$$
  \text{BFTB Score} = \frac{\text{Value Point}}{\text{Store Point}}
$$

The story points of different features are estimated by the development team and the SCRUM master, based on the volume, risk, uncertainty and complexity of the features. The value points of them are estimated by the product owners. \textbf{Fabonacci sequence} is used to provided relative estimation to both story point and value point. Each story point equals about an hour of work.

Except for the tree future user stories at the end of the product backlog table, all others are must-have stories because they are key requirements defined by Jess and James.

\subsection{Must-have Story Points}
Without calculating the features needed in the future, the total number of must-have story points is 60.
$$
SP_{total} = 60 \text{ (Story Point)}
$$

\subsection{Velocity Estimating}
There are two developers in our team. Since both of them are students, each of them can only spend about 1.2 to 1.5 hours a day on the project. They can work five days a week, so the total working hours of a week are 12 to 15 hours. We expect each story point to be equivalent to one hour of working time. So the min velocity ($V_{min}$) for a two-week sprint is about 24 story points, and the max velocity ($V_{max}$) is about 30 story points. And by using the formula shown below, we can get our minimum and maximum number of sprints, which are 2 and 2.5, respectively. The inital burndown chart for the whole project is shown on figure \ref{fig:burndown1}.
$$
S_{min} = \frac{SP_{total}}{V_{max}}
\text{, } 
S_{max} = \frac{SP_{total}}{V_{min}}
$$

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
\subsubsection{Sprint Cycle}
\label{sec:sprintCycle}
The development phase of our project would start on \textbf{Monday, April 25}. Since the final delivery due date of the whole project is \textbf{June 1}, we decided to divide our development into three phases, each corresponding to a sprint.

The first phase is to let the website go online without the function of purchase. The website can display all kinds of information about the products and provide the service of user registration. At the same time, the database is initially established to record the data of users and products. The first sprint will last for two weeks, \textbf{from Monday, April 27 to Friday, May 8}. 


In the second phase, we need to realize the function that users place orders to purchase products, and sellers can view and modify user orders. Preliminary testing will also take place at this phase. The second sprint will last for two weeks, \textbf{from Monday, May 11 to Friday, May 22}.

The third stage is mainly based on user feedback to repair the vulnerability, carry out more tests and improve the existing functions. If some functions left over from the first two sprints are not implemented, they will also be solved in this sprint. As the project is nearing its end and there is less work left, the sprint in this phase will last only one week, \textbf{from Monday, May 25 to Friday, May 29.}

On \textbf{the first Monday of every sprint}, a Sprint Planning meeting would be held to select high priority items from the product backlog that the development team can commit to delivering in a single Sprint. The select itmes would be add to Sprint Backlog.

On \textbf{the last Friday of each sprint}, a Sprint Review meeting would be held to demonstrate the new features to Stakeholders, and a Sprint Retrospective meeting would be held to review the sprint.

A 15-minute Daily SCRUM would be held \textbf{everyday} to start up the jobs. Everyone has to share what he/she did yesterday, what he/she plan to do, and what obstacles are slowing him/her.

\subsection{The First Sprint Plan}
As mention in section \ref{sec:sprintCycle}, the main goal of the first sprint is to launch a webpage where customers can browse products. Considering both the BFTB Score, which is shown in table \ref{tab:productBacklog} and the actual development needs, the Sprint Backlog of the first sprint is shown in table \ref{tab:firstSprintBacklog}. The total velocity and the delivery value of the first sprint is 30 story points and 25 value points, respectively.

Trello is used as the PMP board to help us manage our SCRUM process. After the first sprint planning, the PMP board of our project is shown in Figure \ref{fig:firstSprintPmpBoard}. The label of the card is about the value point of the feature. The Story point of the feature is shown in the upper right corner of the card.
