\chapter*{Executive Summary}
   Jess and James plan to change their business model by getting a web-based system for online ordering of their produce box offerings. In this way, they may be able to gain more orders while maintaining their existing customer base. Because Jess and James want to reduce the cost of website development, the JJFresh online store will be implemented by a student team from the University of Melbourne.

   In this project, Jess and James are the Bussiness Owners of the project. The teaching team of the Software Processes and Management subject would take the role of Product Owner and help the student team to complete the project. As the approach we used to deliver our project is Scrum, the student team would cooperate as a Scrum team to maximize their efficiency. The customers of JJFresh would be our main external stakeholders.

   Through communication with Jess and James, the student team fully understood the needs of Jess and James. All the in-scope and out-scope requirements of the project have been defined and confirmed by Jess and James. Three future enhancement would not be considered in the initial development. Besides, base on the consideration of flexibility and the speed of website delivery, Scrum is chosen as our software development cycle model.

   The business value of this project is to meet the need of the people who want to buy fruit and vegetables from JJFresh but cannot go during the business hours of the physical store. The increase in orders would also increase the revenue of the store. Moreover, the teaching team and the student team can gain benefits from this project.

   The risks of the project have been analyzed, and possible solutions for them are also provided in this report. The technology we choose to implement the online store is \textit{Wix}, which can help quickly create a website. Since we are a virtual team, we mainly use a cloud-based video conferencing tool called \textit{Zoom} to communicate. \textit{Slack} is also used to help us exchange information and resources.

   The Scrum process would be finished in 5 weeks, from April 27 to May 8. There would be three sprints in our Scrum process. Due to the time constraints of the project, the first two sprint would last two weeks, while the last one would only last one week. All of the story points would be assigned to the first two sprints. The last sprint is only used for flexible control.

   Through rough estimation, the project will cost Jess and James about \$ 3,000. The project will provide Jess and James with an online store, which is expected to increase their revenue.

\section{Scope}
\subsection{What is in-scope?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Login system}: Users need to register an account with personal information for the first time. They should be able to log in with an email address and a password. After log in to the online store website, they are able to manage their orders. The owners of JJFresh should have an admin account to manage all the orders. Both customer account and admin account would be accessible from a single URL.
  
  \textit{High priority}: An online store website is not only for browsing information but also a platform for trading fruits and vegetables. Without a Login system, either the customers or Jess and James can manage their orders.

  \item \textbf{Management of personal information}: Users should be able to add or edit their personal information. The name, home address, and upon three multiple contact phone numbers are included in the personal information.
  
  \textit{High priority}: If the customers change their phone number or address, this function is important to avoid some trouble caused by outdated information. Without this feature, Jess and James may deliver products to the wrong address and cannot contact the buyer.
  
  \item \textbf{Products display system}: The website should be able to display different types of products with different sizes and prices to the users. At least three different types of produce boxes with three different sizes would be provided.
  
  \textit{High priority}: Users should be able to know what products they can buy in the online store. The prices of the products should be shown based on the types, sizes, and the number of products selected by customers.
  
  \item \textbf{Order management system}: Users should be able to place their orders after selecting what they want. When the booking is final, a confirmation email containing information about the date, time, type, and size of the box would be sent to the customer. If customers want to modify an existing order, they have to cancel and recreate it. Jess and James should be able to manage these orders on the website.
  
  \textit{High priority}: It is the basic part of the purchase function. An online store cannot do any business without an order management system.
  
  \item \textbf{Database system} A database system that can store information about users, products, and orders is required.
  
  \textit{High priority}: An online store is a type of software products that need a database system to store more and more data.
  
  \item \textbf{Date selecting system}: In this project, the customer should be able to choose a day and time for delivery. Delivery options are in hour blocks. Only two bookings are allowed in a particular hour. Bookings should be available for the next seven days only.
  
  \textit{High priority}: Because JJFresh online store offers delivery service, a date selection system is required to avoid date conflict and  feasible delivery solutions.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{What is out-of-scope?}
The features in the future enhancements are out-of-scope:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An online payment system is not included in the initial development of the project. The physical delivery details need to be considered by Jess and James. 
  \item No AI solution would be provided to help improve the delivery process. 
  \item Adding multiple bookings for the same time slot is not currently allowed. Only two bookings are allowed in a particular hour.
\end{enumerate}

Also, the features below are out-of-scope:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item No navigation system on delivery is included. The system will not verify the authenticity of the address. Jess and James have to find their way to their customers' addresses themselves.
  \item No delivery distance calculate function would be provided. The system will not judge whether the address is too far, so Jess and James have to decide whether they would deliver to an address or not. 
  \item Communication service with customers except confirmation message sending is not included. Jess and James have to decide how to communicate with their customers themselves.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Delivery approach}
The delivery approach we choose for our project is \textbf{Scrum}, an agile method that can provide high flexibility and quick delivery. Our decision is based on the following reasons.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Scrum can provide an incremental delivery system to help the JJFresh online store retain flexibility while continually producing outcomes. As each sprint backlog represents a new release of the product, we can shorten the time for the project to our clients and improve the user experience of the website based on the feedback from them. Clients are continuously involved during every stage. And it can reduce waste and rework and increase the satisfaction of clients.
  \item The sprint process in the Scrum model can provide regular adaptation to changing circumstances. Unlike the Waterfall model, which is very difficult to move back to makes changes in the previous phases, using Scrum would make the development of the JJFresh online store website able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, allowing for changes to be easily incorporated if required.
  \item By doing sprint review and sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint, the client and team know exactly what is complete and what is not. This reduces the risk in the development process.
  \item Scrum intends small or mid-sized dedicated teams with high coordination, which is suitable for our team with five members. The Waterfall model, which involves large teams and lack of coordination among team members, can not meet our needs.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Business Value}
JJFresh is currently busy in the morning but almost empty in the afternoon. The deployment of this project will keep JJFresh's existing customers who shop in the morning and shift the afternoon business hours from offline to online, which offers delivery service for current and potential customers who cannot go to JJFresh store at that time. The online store will operate 24 / 7, which is much longer compare to the old business hours, thus provides customers with the convenience of placing orders at any time. With these advantages, the online store project would attack more customers for JJFresh. The increase in customers can increase fruit and vegetable orders, and therefore help Jess and James gain more financial benefits and avoid JJFresh from being closed. The financial and Non-Financial benefits for different stakeholders are shown in Table \ref{tab:businessValue}.

  \toprule
  Stakeholders & Financial benefits & Non-Financial Benefits \\
  \midrule
  Jess and James
  & Jess and James are the business owners of the JJFresh online store project. The success of the project can help them change their business model. They would gain more customers due to the extension of the business model. Also, the increase in customers would increase the number of orders, which can increase their revenue.
  & They can gain experience in operating an online fruit shop. The online store website can also increase the chance of JJFresh being searched by a search engine of a browser, which can improve the exposure, thereby improving their brand awareness. 
  \\
  \midrule
  The teaching team
  & The teaching team of the Software Processes and Management subject is employed by the school. They can get salary by guiding students.
  & Teaching students in this project can increase their experience in teaching and management.
  \\
  \midrule
  The student team
  & If the project achieves commercial success, students may receive financial awards from Jess and James.
  & They would gain software development experience from the project, which can increase their project experience and help boost their CV. Also, working as a team can improve their teamwork ability.
  \\
  \midrule
  Customers
  & For the customers who are used to buy fruits from JJFresh, home delivery can save them time and money. They don't need to spend money on transportation to jjfresh. Of course, the delivery fee must be considered. But it would be a trade-off.
  & Customers would be able to buy fruits and vegetables with high quality in a more convenient way. Also, for unforeseen circumstances like Covid-19, buying online can reduce their unnecessary travel and keep them safe.

\section{Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Team members are lack of experience in Scrum. Scrum is an Agile process and is difficult to do without experience, especially an experienced Scrum master. The student who plays the role of Scrum master has no Scrum management experience before. There may be many problems during the development process.
  \item People in the development team are unfamiliar with creating a website in Wix.com. Also, students who are responsible for the implementation of the project are not full-time workers. The efficiency of their development may be low, which may result in the delay of the project.
  \item A virtual team may not able to follow all the processes in Scrum. Appropriate improvements and compromises would be applied to some specific processes in the Scrum. Communication in a virtual team is less frequent and less rich than face-to-face interaction. Some of the team members are not in Australia, and because of the time difference, daily Scrum will be conducted via chat, which may bring negative effects to the project.
  \item The tool provided by Wix.com only has limited functions, which make it impossible to achieve the requirements perfectly. And the website implement by Wix.com has poor scalability. If Jess and James want to expand their business scale, the development team may have to redevelop the entire project with other web technics.
  \item The delivery range of Jess and James is limited, and users who are too far away cannot get services.
  \item The time limit of the project is only about one month. The overall implementation of the project may not be perfect in such a short time.

\section{Communication Plan}
\label{sec:communicationPlan}
Firstly, as a virtual team, we mainly use \textit{Slack} and \textit{Zoom} for information transfer, such as publishing message notifications, file sharing, etc. 

Secondly, we use \textit{Trello} to help manage our Agile Board. Both the Project Backlog and the Sprint Backlog are managed on the Agile Board.

Furthermore, \textit{Github} is used to help enhance our teamwork and to manage our outcomes, such as the release of code and report.

According to the constraints of running a virtual team (Section \ref{sec:constraints}), we adjusted some of the communication processes in Scrum, and our communications matrix is shown in table \ref{tab:communicationMatrix}.

  & Limiting the number of times a user can cancel per week and limiting the time when the user cancels the order can help reduce the impact of this risk. For example, cancelation within 24 hours of the specified delivery time is not allowed. Also, customers would be asked to pay an advance deposit to reduce the economic loss caused by cancelation.

  & Users cannot receive feedback from the system.
  & Users(Jess \& James and customers)
  & If this risk occurs due to network failure, the system should be able to detect the user's network conditions and provide prompts automatically. The operation of the user to place an order is idempotent, which means that two identical operations will only operate once. If there is a problem with the function of auto-replying emails, the administrator of the maintenance system should be able to detect it in the background, the system is abnormal, and fix the bug in time.

  & If an unnecessary travel ban policy is announced, Jess and James have to follow the rules and cancel their orders with an apology email sent to their customers. If the order cannot be delivered in time because the seller is sick or other assents, they can decide to hire another person to deliver or cancel their orders. It would be a trade-off between economic loss and user satisfaction loss.

Among all technologies we researched above, we choose to use Wix content management system to build the website. Wix requires no coding skills or other usage of frameworks. It supports drag and drop to build web pages and provides a user-friendly UI to set the style of web components that integrates HTML and CSS from codes into user interfaces. And Wix also provides user-friendly UI to react to user actions with event handlers, this supports visualization of JavaScript. So far, Wix substitutes all front end languages or frameworks coding with user interfaces without any code. And Wix conceals the back end code in encapsulated apps, but also let users to implement customized logic using Node.js. Nonetheless, Wix offers a database operated by itself which also supports changes through graphical user interface. This database maintains the consistency of the usage of Wix platform, without extra database construction.

Compare to other website builders, Wix is more flexibly as it supports usage of Node.js to write customized backend code and take action when doing processes. And it already provides ready-made modules including online shop, user login, user permission management, and check out with credit card which can be used in developing the JJFresh website.

By using Wix, we will save time of building and integrating the frameworks and adjusting the component properties with the help of visible user interface.And since we don't have much experience in web development, Wix's characteristic that it requires as least coding as possible is suitable us, and can help us focus on project management instead of catching up with the technology stacks. Therefore, we decided to use Wix to develop the website.

\section{Project Planning}
\label{sec:projectPlanning}
The SDLC of our project is Scrum. Since the key requirements for the initial development provided by Jess and James are fixed, a Fixed-Scope Release Planning would be used to plan our project.

\subsection{Product Backlog}
The detail of product backlog is shown in table \ref{tab:productBacklog}. BFTB Score is the abbreviate of the Bang-for-the-Buck Score, which is a way of measuring how to get the most value in the shortest time. It is used to help assess the priority of the features. The BFTB Score is calculated by the formula below:
$$
  \text{BFTB Score} = \frac{\text{Value Point}}{\text{Store Point}}
$$

The story points of different features are estimated by the development team and the Scrum master, based on the volume, risk, uncertainty and complexity of the features. The value points of them are estimated by the product owners. \textbf{Fabonacci sequence} is used to provided relative estimation to both story point and value point. Each story point equals about an hour of work.

Except for the tree future user stories at the end of the product backlog table, all others are must-have stories because they are key requirements defined by Jess and James.

\subsection{Must-have Story Points}
Without calculating the features needed in the future, the total number of must-have story points is 60.
$$
SP_{total} = 60 \text{ (Story Point)}
$$

\subsection{Velocity Estimating}
There are two developers in our team. Since both of them are students, each of them can only spend about 1.2 to 1.5 hours a day on the project. They can work five days a week, so the total working hours of a week are 12 to 15 hours. We expect each story point to be equivalent to one hour of working time. So the min velocity ($V_{min}$) for a two-week sprint is about 24 story points, and the max velocity ($V_{max}$) is about 30 story points. And by using the formula shown below, we can get our minimum and maximum number of sprints, which are 2 and 2.5, respectively. The inital burndown chart for the whole project is shown on figure \ref{fig:burndown1}.
$$
S_{min} = \frac{SP_{total}}{V_{max}}
\text{, } 
S_{max} = \frac{SP_{total}}{V_{min}}
$$

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
\subsubsection{Sprint Cycle}
\label{sec:sprintCycle}
The development phase of our project would start on \textbf{Monday, April 25}. Since the final delivery due date of the whole project is \textbf{June 1}, we decided to divide our development into three phases, each corresponding to a sprint.

The first phase is to let the website go online without the function of purchase. The website can display all kinds of information about the products and provide the service of user registration. At the same time, the database is initially established to record the data of users and products. The first sprint will last for two weeks, \textbf{from Monday, April 27 to Friday, May 8}. 

In the second phase, we need to realize the function that users place orders to purchase products, and sellers can view and modify user orders. Preliminary testing will also take place at this phase. The second sprint will last for two weeks, \textbf{from Monday, May 11 to Friday, May 22}.

The third stage is mainly based on user feedback to repair the vulnerability, carry out more tests and improve the existing functions. If some functions left over from the first two sprints are not implemented, they will also be solved in this sprint. As the project is nearing its end and there is less work left, the sprint in this phase will last only one week, \textbf{from Monday, May 25 to Friday, May 29.}

On \textbf{the first Monday of every sprint}, a Sprint Planning meeting would be held to select high priority items from the product backlog that the development team can commit to delivering in a single Sprint. The select itmes would be add to Sprint Backlog.

On \textbf{the last Friday of each sprint}, a Sprint Review meeting would be held to demonstrate the new features to Stakeholders, and a Sprint Retrospective meeting would be held to review the sprint.

A 15-minute Daily Scrum would be held \textbf{everyday} to start up the jobs. Everyone has to share what he/she did yesterday, what he/she plan to do, and what obstacles are slowing him/her.

\subsection{The First Sprint Plan}
As mention in section \ref{sec:sprintCycle}, the main goal of the first sprint is to launch a webpage where customers can browse products. Considering both the BFTB Score, which is shown in table \ref{tab:productBacklog} and the actual development needs, the Sprint Backlog of the first sprint is shown in table \ref{tab:firstSprintBacklog}. The total velocity and the delivery value of the first sprint is 30 story points and 25 value points, respectively.
